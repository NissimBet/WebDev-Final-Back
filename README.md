# WebDev-Final-Back

This project is inspired by many applications that give gamers information of their matches on games like [League of Legends](https://zeit.co/),
[Dota 2](http://blog.dota2.com/) and [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/). 
The objective of the application is to provide a place for players to create builds for their champions and share them among other players.
As well as set some of their champions as favorites.

This application was created by [Nissim Betesh](https://github.com/NissimBet) and [Carlos Tamez](https://github.com/CyberFroppy)

## Web Develpment final project

This project consists of 2 parts, the front end application and the backend application.
The front was created using the [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) framework for React and Typescript. 

The backend code is at [/WebDev-Final-Back](https://github.com/NissimBet/WebDev-Final-Back) and hosted with Heroku,
The front is hosted with [Zeit](https://zeit.co/)

The backend is using a [mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) databse and runs a server with [Express](https://expressjs.com/).
It acts as a middleware between the server and the database to get information of the users and their champions/builds.

## To develop the backend of the app

1. Install all dependencies with `npm i`
2. Run development mode with `npm run dev`
